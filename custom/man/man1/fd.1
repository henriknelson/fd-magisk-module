.SH NAME
fd \- manual page for fd 8.0.0
.SH DESCRIPTION
fd 8.0.0
.SS "USAGE:"
.IP
fd [FLAGS/OPTIONS] [<pattern>] [<path>...]
.SS "FLAGS:"
.HP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hidden\fR
.IP
Include hidden directories and files in
the search results (default: hidden files
and directories are skipped). Files and
directories are considered to be hidden
if their name starts with a `.` sign
(dot).
.HP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-no\-ignore\fR
.IP
Show search results from files and
directories that would otherwise be
ignored by '.gitignore', '.ignore' or
\&'.fdignore' files.
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-ignore\-vcs\fR
.IP
Show search results from files and
directories that would otherwise be
ignored by '.gitignore' files.
.HP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-unrestricted\fR
.IP
Alias for '\-\-no\-ignore'. Can be repeated.
\&'\-uu' is an alias for '\-\-no\-ignore
\fB\-\-hidden\fR'.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-case\-sensitive\fR
.IP
Perform a case\-sensitive search. By
default, fd uses case\-insensitive
searches, unless the pattern contains an
uppercase character (smart case).
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-case\fR
.IP
Perform a case\-insensitive search. By
default, fd uses case\-insensitive
searches, unless the pattern contains an
uppercase character (smart case).
.HP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-glob\fR
.IP
Perform a glob\-based search instead of a
regular expression search.
.HP
\fB\-\-regex\fR
.IP
Perform a regular\-expression based search
(default). This can be used to override
\fB\-\-glob\fR.
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-fixed\-strings\fR
.IP
Treat the pattern as a literal string
instead of a regular expression.
.HP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-absolute\-path\fR
.IP
Shows the full path starting from the
root as opposed to relative paths.
.HP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\-details\fR
.IP
Use a detailed listing format like 'ls
\fB\-l\fR'. This is basically an alias for
\&'\-\-exec\-batch ls \fB\-l\fR' with some additional
\&'ls' options. This can be used to see
more metadata, to show symlink targets
and to achieve a deterministic sort
order.
.HP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-follow\fR
.IP
By default, fd does not descend into
symlinked directories. Using this flag,
symbolic links are also traversed.
.HP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-full\-path\fR
.IP
By default, the search pattern is only
matched against the filename (or
directory name). Using this flag, the
pattern is matched against the full path.
.HP
\fB\-0\fR, \fB\-\-print0\fR
.IP
Separate search results by the null
character (instead of newlines). Useful
for piping results to 'xargs'.
.HP
\fB\-1\fR
.IP
Limit the search to a single result and
quit immediately. This is an alias for
\&'\-\-max\-results=1'.
.HP
\fB\-\-show\-errors\fR
.IP
Enable the display of filesystem errors
for situations such as insufficient
permissions or dead symlinks.
.HP
\fB\-\-one\-file\-system\fR
.IP
By default, fd will traverse the file
system tree as far as other options
dictate. With this flag, fd ensures that
it does not descend into a different file
system than the one it started in.
Comparable to the \fB\-mount\fR or \fB\-xdev\fR filters
of find(1).
.HP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Prints help information
.HP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Prints version information
.SS "OPTIONS:"

depth. By default, there is no limit on
the search depth.

.IP
Only show search results starting at the
given depth. See also: '\-\-max\-depth' and
\&'\-\-exact\-depth'
.HP
\fB\-\-exact\-depth\fR <depth>
.IP
Only show search results at the exact
given depth. This is an alias for '\-\-mindepth <depth> \fB\-\-max\-depth\fR
<depth>'.

their file extension. Multiple allowable
file extensions can be specified.
.HP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-exec\fR <cmd>
.IP
Execute a command for each search result.
All arguments following \fB\-\-exec\fR are taken
to be arguments to the command until the
argument ';' is encountered.
Each occurrence of the following
placeholders is substituted by a path
derived from the current search result
before the command is executed:
.TP
\&'{}':
path
.TP
\&'{/}':

substituted by the paths derived from the
search results before the command is
executed:

\fB\-\-changed\-within\fR <date|dur>
.IP
Filter results based on the file
modification time. The argument can be
provided as a specific point in time
(YYYY\-MM\-DD HH:MM:SS) or as a duration
(10h, 1d, 35min). '\-\-change\-newer\-than'
can be used as an alias.

modification time. The argument can be
provided as a specific point in time
(YYYY\-MM\-DD HH:MM:SS) or as a duration
(10h, 1d, 35min). '\-\-change\-older\-than'
can be used as an alias.

\fB\-\-base\-directory\fR <path>
.IP
Change the current working directory of
fd to the provided path. The means that
search results will be shown with respect

\&'\-\-search\-path' option will also be
resolved relative to this directory.
.HP
\fB\-\-path\-separator\fR <separator>

OS\-specific separator ('/' on Unix, '\e'
on Windows).

Provide paths to search as an alternative
to the positional <path> argument.
Changes the usage to `fd [FLAGS/OPTIONS]
